Heat Exposure and Disease Burden Across Indian States (2016–2023)

Background Heat exposure is an important environmental factor with potential implications for population health in India. Large geographic and climatic variation across Indian states provides an opportunity to explore how patterns of heat exposure and disease burden vary spatially.

This project presents an exploratory, descriptive analysis of state-level heat exposure and disease burden in India using publicly available secondary data.

Research Question How does disease burden vary across Indian states with differing levels of heat exposure?

Data Sources - Disease burden estimates: Global Burden of Disease (GBD), state-level DALYs per 100,000 population - Heat exposure: India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded daily maximum temperature (1°×1° resolution), aggregated to annual state-level means

Both datasets include state identifiers and year, allowing alignment for the period 2016–2023.

Methods Daily maximum temperature values were aggregated to annual mean maximum temperature and spatially averaged at the state level using administrative boundary shapefiles. Disease burden and heat exposure data were merged by state and year.

Analysis is descriptive and includes visualizations, summary statistics, and correlation measures to explore broad patterns.

Outputs - Scatter plot of heat exposure vs disease burden - Bar chart of states ranked by average disease burden - Summary tables of descriptive statistics

Limitations - Analysis is based on secondary, aggregated data - No causal inference is attempted - State-level aggregation may mask within-state variation - Results are sensitive to data quality and reporting practices
